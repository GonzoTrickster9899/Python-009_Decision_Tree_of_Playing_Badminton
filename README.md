Using historical data above. Create a decison tree using illustration that shows the computation for entropy and the decision taken on creating 
splits based on information gain. Develop also a python code that will going to implement the same model as a classification algorithm based on
the data here.

Note: You can change the source code if there is something wrong or must correct that what I intepreted on data. Thank you very much.
